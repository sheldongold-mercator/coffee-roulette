Hey Team! 👋

I've finished building **Coffee Roulette** - our internal employee pairing system for fostering cross-department connections. The app is complete and ready for testing!

🎯 **What's Done:**
✅ Full backend API (Node.js + Express, 40+ endpoints)
✅ Polished React admin dashboard with analytics
✅ Smart matching algorithm
✅ Microsoft OAuth integration (needs your help!)
✅ Calendar & email/Teams notifications
✅ All code pushed to GitHub: https://github.com/sheldongold-mercator/coffee-roulette

🚨 **What I Need (Urgent):**
To test locally before AWS deployment, I need:
1. Azure AD Client ID, Tenant ID, and Client Secret
2. Redirect URIs configured (localhost for testing + production URLs)
3. API permissions granted (User.Read, User.Read.All, Calendars.ReadWrite)

📋 **Next Steps:**
- **This Week:** Local testing with real Microsoft auth
- **Next Week:** Deploy to AWS with subdomains (coffee-roulette.mercator.com)

I've attached a detailed doc with full technical specs, architecture diagram, and everything you need to help get this set up.

Can you help get the Azure AD credentials sorted? Happy to jump on a call if easier!

Thanks! 🙏
Sheldon
